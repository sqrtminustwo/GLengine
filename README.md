# GLengine

Sick game engine, never done before (it has 2 cubes, and one of them is spinning, i definitely did not just follow learnopengl guide). Also, it will not run on windows and all libs are built on ubuntu 24.04.3, cous like who do you think i am, a crossplatform developer? But at least i built a cool terminal fps counter with FTXUI (which turned into a [side project](https://github.com/sqrtminustwo/TerminalPlot)), completely game engine unrelated tho, i tried doing it in opengl and broke my system by installing freetype (who knew ubuntu desktop manager uses freetype) so i guess i will stick to terminal for now =). Below you can find a screenshot of the latest stage of the engine (updated on each noticable change).
